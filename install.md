# Installing

How to get started with Lua and LÖVE, and with this project using Git.

## Lua

Lua is a cool Brazilian scripting language that was also my first programming language. I learned it to program addons for World of Warcraft when I used to play that.

Get it for Linux using your respective package manager
* [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=lua), also used by my favorite TWM (tiling window manager), [Awesome](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=awesome)

Get it for [Windows](https://code.google.com/p/luaforwindows/)

## LÖVE

LÖVE is a neat Lua framework for making 2D things, like games. It handles all the lower level functionality but provides a ton of space for making a game to the scale of your desire (really a property of Lua).

Get it for Linux using your respective package manager
* [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=love)

## Git

Git is an awesome and fairly simple to use source control management system (SCM). Its the only SCM I've learned to use, but does wonders for productivity.
