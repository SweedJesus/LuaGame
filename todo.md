# TODO

## Button Overhaul
- The current flag system for handling button presses is insufficient and not effect for use with simulated presses (through key bindings especially).
- May want to merge the functionality of buttons with standard entities

## Keybinds
- No finalized strategy for managing key binds
    - In state entities?
